# CodeCraftsman - Visual Studio Code Extension

## Project Overview
CodeCraftsman is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to assist developers by streamlining code generation and providing intelligent code suggestions and templates for a variety of programming languages. This extension aims to simplify coding tasks, improve productivity, and enhance code consistency.

## Agenda
The primary goals of the CodeCraftsman project include:

### 1. Language-Aware Code Suggestions
- Detect the programming language context in the currently opened file.
- Offer intelligent code suggestions based on the context and syntax of the detected language.
- Suggest common programming constructs, such as loops, conditionals, and functions, tailored to the detected language.

### 2. Code Snippet Library
- Provide a library of pre-defined code snippets for popular programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C++).
- Allow users to easily insert these snippets to accelerate development.

### 3. User-Defined Code Templates
- Enable users to create and save their own code templates and snippets.
- Include placeholders for dynamic values within these templates.
- Store user-defined templates for future use.

### 4. Dynamic Variable Insertion
- Implement placeholders in code snippets that can be easily replaced with specific variable names, values, and conditions.
- Streamline repetitive coding tasks with this feature.

### 5. Language and Framework Support
- Initially focus on supporting multiple programming languages and popular frameworks, such as JavaScript, Python, React, Angular, Java, and C++.
- Plan for future expansion to accommodate more languages and frameworks.

### 6. User-Defined Abbreviations
- Allow users to define custom abbreviations that trigger code snippet suggestions.
- For example, typing "rfor" could generate a standard "for" loop in the detected language.

### 7. Keyboard Shortcuts
- Implement customizable keyboard shortcuts for quickly inserting code snippets and templates, enhancing user efficiency.

## Features
The CodeCraftsman extension will offer the following key features:

- Automatic language detection within the currently opened file.
- Language-specific code suggestion and completion.
- A library of pre-defined code snippets for various languages.
- User-friendly interface for creating, editing, and saving code templates.
- Placeholder support for easy variable replacement in code snippets.
- Support for popular programming languages and frameworks.
- Customizable abbreviations for triggering code suggestions.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick snippet insertion.

With these features, CodeCraftsman aims to enhance the development experience, save time, and maintain code consistency, making it a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced developers.
